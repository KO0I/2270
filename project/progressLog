  Bill prototyped the ball and magnet. Tested rolling ok.
  I tested the following items with regards to the LEDs:
    Range: max value under 6"
               303mV at about 22"
           over 25", the voltage measured becomes unstable and has amplitude
                     under 130mV.
    Behavior: works as expected, but range is discouraging
